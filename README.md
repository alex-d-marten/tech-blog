# tech-blog

## Description

This project contains the code required to host a Tech Blog website where users can signup, make posts and comment on other posts. The application utilizes Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and Bcrypt to hash user credentials. The website is considered an MVP at this stage and has room for improvement, but root functionality is present.
